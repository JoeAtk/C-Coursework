## Purpose

This file gives concise, actionable instructions for AI coding agents working in this repo. Focus on the small C coursework app that emits a simple text graphics protocol and is displayed by the provided `launcher` binary.

## Big picture

- The project is plain C sources that emit a textual drawing protocol to stdout. The display renderer is the `launcher` binary (in the repo root). Typical runtime is: run the program and pipe its stdout into `launcher` so the textual commands are rendered.
- Key files:
  - `graphics.h` / `graphics.c` — the graphics API used by student code. Instead of drawing directly, functions print protocol commands (e.g. `DL`, `DR`, `MS`, `SC`, `SW`).
  - `myProgram.c` (example student program) — shows how the API is used (grid drawing, `setWindowSize`, `fillRect`, etc.).
  - `launcher` — binary consumer of protocol (reads textual commands and displays UI). It is not editable as text in the repo.

## Runtime / build workflow (PowerShell)

- Quick compile (gcc) for development and debugging (PowerShell):

```powershell
gcc -g -O0 myProgram.c graphics.c -o myProgram.exe
.\myProgram.exe | .\launcher
```

- Release build (strip optimizations):

```powershell
gcc -O2 myProgram.c graphics.c -o myProgram.exe
.\myProgram.exe | .\launcher
```

Notes: `graphics.c` prints protocol tokens to stdout. `launcher` reads stdin — so piping (`|`) connects them.

## Project-specific patterns and gotchas

- Protocol tokens (examples — keep these stable if you change `graphics.c`):
  - drawLine -> prints: `DL x1 x2 x3 x4`
  - drawRect -> `DR x y w h`
  - fillRect -> `FR x y w h`
  - drawString -> `DS x y @text` — strings are prefixed with `@` and newlines are replaced with the HTML newline entity (ampersand-hash-ten-semicolon) by `replaceNewlineWithEntity`.
  - setColour -> `SC <name>` and setRGBColour -> `RG r g b`
  - setWindowSize -> `SW width height`

- The textual protocol is the contract between student code and `launcher`. If you change command names or formats in `graphics.c`, update `launcher` or the renderer that consumes these commands.

- `graphics.h` contains the API prototypes that student code uses — prefer editing behavior there and keep signatures stable.

## Examples to copy/paste

- Use the API exactly as in `myProgram.c`:

  - set a window size: `setWindowSize(windowSize+10, windowSize+10);`
  - draw a grid: loop with `drawLine(...)` as in `myProgram.c`.
  - fill a cell: `fillRect(x, y, w, h);` (see `fillGrid` helper in `myProgram.c`).

## Debugging hints

- Add `-g -O0` when compiling to enable source-level debugging with gdb (on platforms that support it). Use printf logging — the program already prints graphics commands so interleave debug prints carefully (they will appear on stdout unless redirected).
- To inspect the exact textual protocol output without `launcher`, run and redirect to a file: `.\myProgram.exe > out.txt` then open `out.txt`.

## When to ask maintainer / human

- If you change the text protocol (any `printf` format in `graphics.c`), ask for a test update or provide a compatibility layer — `launcher` expects the current tokens.
- If you need to modify `launcher` but only the binary is present, request the source from the repo owner.
